# hello-world
This is my first repository! Can't wait to start my journey of programming

I am a business-major student who is passionate about machine learning and data analysis! 

That's why I want to launch my github repository and learn coding with my friends. 

BTW, the picture of my profile is the icon of my undergraduate school - Lingnan College of Sun Yat-sen University. I am proud of where I came from.
